Bluelink helped us a lot by making the website, and Steve by giving us 
access to a 24h/24 platform for tests. <br/>Austin.fla is now in charge of 
the website, and special thanks to Black Marauder, Navy, Lutra, Kioku, 
and no italiano for testing.<br/> Darkon provided us with the portuguese 
translation.</article>
