Nintendo and The Pokemon company are finally the ones we must thank the most, for creating such a wonderful world as the Pokemon World. I still remember with nostalgy the Blue Pokemon version, and the saleswoman that was explaining me, that in the blue cartridge, there were 135 Pokemons, and in the red one, only 15 but stronger :'(.
