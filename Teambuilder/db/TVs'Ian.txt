The one that created Pokemon Netbattle. What is Pokemon Netbattle? Don't you know?? O_O It's a pokemon simulator, just as this one, that can be reached at www.netbattle.net.
 
Such a project as ours would never have existed without Netbattle. But the fact is, Netbattle's development has been stopped at the third gen :(. If TVs'Ian'd contact us with an @netbattle.net or an @tvsian.info email address, we'd be really happy.
