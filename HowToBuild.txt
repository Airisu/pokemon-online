HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT:
* Learn how to use Git
* Download all the files using Git
* Install the Qt Framework on your computer, or at least the libraries
* For linux users, install libzip-dev package (For Ubuntu --in a terminal--: sudo apt-get install libzip-dev)
* For windows users, put the file in SpecialInclude into your includepath
* On linux just run the makefile
* On windows open src/Teambuilder/Teambuilder.pro and build and run the project. If you want to run the server, you need to build src/Utilities/Utilities.pro and src/PokemonInfo/PokemonInfo.pro before the server
