Mystra,

we always got your back. When xavier had his arguments, me and Darkness always supported you, yet he kept bringing that up. I'm sorry we couldn't have your back in the following discussions, we weren't active at that time.

Whatever happened in the past, know that as soon as the main site works correctly again, ', using words including "fuck" is a bad starting point' will be added to rule 5, in order to make it clearer and make it easier for the admin to apply the rule. 

As far as we are concerned, Xavier can go to hell if you come back ^^ We don't even know where to find you anymore! Also, if it can help, you can mute people instad of kicking them, so they dont complain in the main chat -- you can always explain to them in PM.

Anyway, come back! If the price for it is you not being in main channel, so be it! But with the rules clarified and everything, you shouldn't have to worry anymore :)

Anyway, I sincerely hope you'll come back see us in indigo
